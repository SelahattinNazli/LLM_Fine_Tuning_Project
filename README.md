## Steps to Improve Fine-Tuning

This project demonstrates the process of fine-tuning a language model using the IMDB dataset. While the initial results may not be optimal, the following strategies can be applied to enhance the model's performance:

1. Increase Training Data Size
2. Balance the Dataset
3. Hyperparameter Tuning
4. Data Augmentation
5. Use a Pre-trained Model with Similar Task
6. Cross-validation
7. Regularization Techniques
8. Early Stopping

## Requirements

- Python
- Transformers Library
- Datasets Library
- PyTorch
- Evaluate Library
